Game Theory Analysis with Numpy in an 3x3 action_space 

Creation of 

* Pay-off matrix  

      A matrix which gives the possible outcome of a two-person zero-sum game when player A has possible moves and player B moves.
      Array made of tuples that will map the situation with actions of each player 

* Iterated Elimination of Stricly Dominated Strategies 

      Game Theory Algorithmn design that looks independly to the playing strategy of each player in which we subselect a game
      that marks which strategy dominates over the other one. 

* Best Response

      A strategy is a best response if and only if a player cannot gain more utility from switching to a different strategy.

* Nash Equilibrium 

      A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to change the strategies
      of players. Nash equilibria are inherently stable.
      
      A game is in a Nash equilibrium if and only if all players are playing best responses to what the other players are doing.
